\section{Abstract}
We create a new word vector model that uses global word co-occurence statistics
AND context windows to create word vectors that get state of the art on the
analogy task.

\section{Introduction}
Latent semantic analysis (LSA) uses global co-ocurrence statistics and the
Skipgram uses local context windows. How can we combine the two?

\section{Related Work}
LSA and other methods are based on factoring a large matrix into a product of
low-rank matrices. Local context windows aim to predict a context (i.e. nearby
words) based on a word.

\section{The GloVe Model}
Our model is called Global Vectors (GloVe).

In order to define this model, we begin with the assumption that we have two
sets of word vectors: regular vectors and context vectors (the latter are
represented with a tilde, like $\tilde{w}$). We'll consider properties that
we'd like these vectors to have and represent these with math. Eventually,
we will have enough properties to get an exact mathematical equation that
we can use to determine the word vectors.

Let $X_{ij}$ be the number of times word $j$ appears in the context of word $i$.
Then let $X_i = \sum_{j}{X_{ij}}$. Let $P_{ij} = X_{ij}/X_i$. Now, suppose
word $i$ is "ice", $j$ is "steam", and $k$ is "solid". In this case, we expect
$P_{ik}/P_{jk} > 1$. So, we can encode this property as follows (for some
function $F$).

$$
F(w_i, w_j, \tilde{w}_k) = \frac{P_{ik}}{P_{jk}}
$$

How do we pick $F$? Well, to enable vector arithmetic, we can make a function
of vector differences: $F(w_i - w_j, \tilde{w}_k)$. Next, we need to figure
how the vector difference will interact with context vector $\tilde{w}_k$ -
dot product is the cleanest way to do this: $F((w_i - w_j)^T \tilde{w}_k)$.
Next, we observe that the distinction between word vectors and context word
vectors is arbitrary, so we should make it possible to exchange the two without
messing up our equation. This gives:

$$
F((w_i - w_j)^T \tilde{w}_k) = \frac{F(w_i^T \tilde{w}_k)}{F(w_j^T \tilde{w}_k)}
= \frac{P_{ik}}{P_{jk}}
$$

One choice of $F$ that satisfies the above is $F(x) = \exp(x)$. This gives:

$$
w_i^T \tilde{w}_k = \log{P_{ik}} = \log{X_{ik}} - \log{X_{i}}
$$

Notice that $X_i$ is independent of $k$, so we can capture it with bias terms:

$$
w_i^T \tilde{w}_k + b_i + \tilde{b}_k = \log{X_{ik}}
$$

One issue with the above model is that all co-occurences are weighted equally.
To fix this, we define a weighting function $f(X_{ij})$ and get cost function:

$$
J = \sum_{i, j = 1}^{V}{
f(X_{ij})(w_i^T \tilde{w}_j + b_i + \tilde{b}_j - \log{X_{ij}})^2
}
$$

where we have (for $x_{max} = 100$ and $\alpha = 3/4$).

$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
      (x/x_{max})^{\alpha} & x < x_{max} \\
      1 & otherwise
   \end{cases}
$$

Interestingly, the Skipgram model can also be formulated using the cost
function that we have described above.

Naively, our cost function seems to take $O(|V|^2)$ time to compute, where
$|V|$ is vocabulary size, which is extremely slow. However, its compute time is
actually proportional to the number of nonzero elements in $X$. If you assume
co-occurences follow a power law distribution, then the compute time is more
like $O(|C|)$, where $|C|$ is the corpus size. This makes it similar to the
compute intensiveness of Skipgram.

\section{Experiments}
We evaluate on the word analogy dataset. Basically, the ground truth is:
word $a$ is to $b$ as $c$ is to $d$. We compute $w_{b} - w_{a} + w_{c}$ and
find the closest (by cosine similarity) word vector. If the vector belongs to
word $d$, then our model answers the anology correctly. We also evaluate on
word similarity tasks and named entity recognition (we use a given set of
features + word vectors for a 5-word window and feed them into a conditional
random field). Our vec

We train on multiple corpora that come from Wikipedia, Gigaword, and Common
Crawl. We set $|V| = 400,000$, $x_{max} = 100$, $\alpha = 3/4$, and a context
window of 10 to the left and 10 to the right. We optimize with Adagrad with
a learning rate of 0.05, We get word embedding matrices $W$ and $\tilde{W}$
and we use $W + \tilde{W}$ as our final word vectors. Our vectors have length
300. It takes 85 minutes to populate $X$ (single thread) and 14 minutes to
do optimization (32 cores).

We set state of the art on the analogy task, beating word2vec (i.e. Skipgram)
with a corpus half as large. We also beat other models on Named Entity
Recognition, which shows that GloVe vectors are useful features. GloVe trains
faster than word2vec.

\section{Conclusion}
We strike a balance between global co-occurence counts and local context
windows, which allows to create GloVe word vectors that beat other word
vectors on word analogies and also serve as useful features in Named Entity
Recognition.
